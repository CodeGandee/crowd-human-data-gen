# AIGC GUI Documentation

Welcome to the **AIGC GUI** project - an AI-Generated Content platform built on top of Stable Diffusion models for advanced image generation capabilities.

## Overview

AIGC GUI is a comprehensive FastAPI-based web application that provides various AI-powered image generation features including:

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create images from textual descriptions
- **Image-to-Image Transformation**: Transform existing images based on prompts
- **Inpainting**: Fill in missing parts of images intelligently
- **LoRA Adapters**: Fine-tuned model adaptations for specific styles
- **IP Adapters**: Image prompt adapters for style transfer
- **Multiple Model Support**: Support for SD 1.5 and SDXL models

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Multiple Generation Modes
- Text-to-image generation with various models
- Image-to-image transformation
- Inpainting and outpainting capabilities
- Person generation and refinement pipelines

### ðŸ”§ Model Support
- **Stable Diffusion v1.5**: `stable_diffusion_v15`, `dreamshaper_sd15`, `realistic_vision_sd15`
- **SDXL Models**: `stable_diffusion_xl`, `dreamshaper_xl`, `juggernaut_xl`, `proto_vision_xl`, `night_vision_xl`
- LoRA and IP adapter support for model customization

### ðŸš€ Performance Optimized
- Built with FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
- MongoDB integration with GridFS for large file storage
- Background task processing for long-running operations
- BentoML integration for model serving

### ðŸ”Œ Developer Friendly
- RESTful API design
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Modular pipeline architecture
- Easy model configuration and switching
